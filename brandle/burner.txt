Implementing User Sign on

x Update current path to be "play as guest"
x create new 'users' file...yaml? 
x create 'login' form next to "play as guest" form
x creat login path (don't worry about creating new users yet)
- Implement plaintext login
- if unsuccessful, redirect to login with option to go back home
- if successful, redirect to ":username/play"
- for now, let username/play be the same as normal play
- celebrate!
- encrypt passwords, BCrypt?


- implement ":username/play" to be play as normal, but to keep track of wins and losses/played words
